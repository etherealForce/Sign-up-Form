# Sign-up-Form

Hello, and welcome to my new project. For the past few weeks, I have been studying some css and more html stuff. Here, I'd like to flex (demonstrate) my newly acquired skills and stuff.

I play to create a simple sign up form page with some custom fonts, images and will try my best to create a nice looking color scheme to match with the content and aesthetics of the site and everything.
